# Booking Scheduler Test
A simple front-end test involving user profiles & timeslots

## Getting started
Your task is to create a booking scheduler system which executes this [user flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/User%20Flow.png).

### User flow examples
Here are example screenshots which follows the user flow from above,

2. [User Show](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/User%20Show.png)
3. [Booking Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Form.png)
4. [Booking Form 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Form%202.png)
5. [Booking Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Success.png)

### User Profiles
You are given example character profiles, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/blob/master/character_profiles).

You are allowed to copy the profiles into your code, and add details to the array/hash if it helps in your methods or iterations.
However, core details such as the **name, profession, photo & availability** should be left unchanged.
