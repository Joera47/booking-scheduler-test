# Booking Scheduler Test
A simple front-end test involving user profiles & timeslots

## Getting started
Your task is to create a booking scheduler system which executes this [user flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/User%20Flow.png).

### User flow examples
Here are example screenshots which follows the user flow from above,

1. [User Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/User%20Index.png)
2. [User Show](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/User%20Show.png)
3. [Booking Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Form.png)
4. [Booking Form 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Form%202.png)
5. [Booking Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/master/flows/Booking%20Success.png)

### User Profiles
You are given example character profiles, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Joera47/booking-scheduler-test/blob/master/character_profiles).

You are allowed to copy the profiles into your code, and add details to the array/hash if it helps in your methods or iterations.
However, core details such as the **name, profession, photo & availability** should be left unchanged.

## Your Task
- You will need to create a mock mobile app based on your designed user flows.
- Having a database is not necessary and it is not necessary to save the bookings created. This is just a mock, and what is important is that information selected or submitted in the previous page carries over to the next.
- Should have efficient logic, as in it should not be hard-coded.
- Have visually acceptable/pleasing styling.
- You will need to present your mobile app mock at the end of the presentation, on projector.
